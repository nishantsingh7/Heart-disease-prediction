# Heart-disease-prediction
Developed a data-driven heart disease prediction system employing Scikit-learn, Matplotlib,Pandas, and NumPy.
Trained machine learning models including LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNearest Neighbors (KNN) to accurately determine the presence of heart disease.
Utilized rigorous model selection and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal evaluation metrics.
Utilized Matplotlib for clear data visualization and insightful result interpretation
